# Student Management System  

## Overview  
The **Student Management System** is a **learning-based project** built in Java to simulate basic student data management operations. It demonstrates how to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data in a console-based application, with optional database integration for persistence.

---

## Purpose   
- Understand object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java.  
- Practice data management and database connectivity.  
- Build a console-based application with user authentication.  

---

## Features  
1. **User Authentication**  
   - Simulated login and registration for accessing the system.  

2. **CRUD Operations**  
   - **Add Student**: Add a new student with details (Name, Roll Number, Grade).  
   - **Remove Student**: Delete student details based on roll number.  
   - **Search Student**: Search for a student by roll number.  
   - **Display All Students**: View all student records.  

3. **Database Integration**  
   - Data persistence using JDBC with MySQL.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Database**: JDBC with MySQL.  
- **Tools**: Java IDE (Eclipse), Git for version control.
